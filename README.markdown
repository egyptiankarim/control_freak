# Welcome to `control_freak`!

`control_freak` is a part of the [Risk Redux](https://risk-redux.io) project, which seeks to turn NIST frameworks into practical web applications.

Realizing that _[NIST SP 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-4/final)_ is a fantastic reference for cybersecurity controls, but that <kbd>âŒ˜ + F</kbd>-ing through dense PDFs was a fool's errand, we created `control_freak` to support some simple searching capabilities (poorly) and provide a simpler organization of all the interconnected information.
