# control_freak

Utterly exhausted with the process of Google searching for a NIST special publication, searching for a particular version of in the document library, loading the file in some Adobe app, and then <kbd>⌘ + F</kbd>-ing my way through the hundreds of pages… I took matters into my own hands.

Thus was born [control_freak][control_freak]. It’s a simple Ruby on Rails application filled with data that I parsed out of the frequently reference 800-53 (essentially a catalogue of security controls). The application supports some searching capabilities (poorly) and a simpler organization of all the interconnected information that is currently locked into those god awful PDFs. Huzzah!
