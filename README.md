# Welcome to `control_freak`!

`control_freak` is a part of the [Risk Redux](https://risk-redux.io) project, which seeks to turn NIST frameworks into practical web applications.

The `rev-5` branch represents [draft content from NIST SP 800-53, Rev 5](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5-draft.pdf).

The schema for `rev-5` is significantly different from previous versions and merging them all would be messy. Instead, Risk-Redux will be deploying two versions of `control_freak` in parallel until such time that people stop using older versions. Specifically, we'll host `rev-5` at [https://controlfreak5.risk-redux.io](https://controlfreak5.risk-redux.io).
